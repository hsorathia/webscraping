# HTML SCRIPTS

Some cute little scripts to download things that I care about from the internet.


## To install the packages

install the pip packages using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then you can run the programs.

  - Run through html_to_latex.py
1. Qalam: downloading podcasts from qalam
  - run through generator.py
